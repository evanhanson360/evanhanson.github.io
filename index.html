            <h1>Welcome to my page!</h1>
            <p>My name is Evan Hanson, and this is a showcase of some of my best work (or favorite work), all divided in their own respective genres of photography.</p>
            <p>Growing up in Salt Lake City, Utah, I developed a passion for nature and skiing. I want to be able to fuse photography with this passion, as the combinations of what I love to do is something I want to take seriously.</p>
            <p>Please enjoy some of work, as I hope it would invoke some emotions, and some imagination as well.</p>
